2.What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3.What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4.Which skills are associated with higher salaries?

# Tools I used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market,I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL :** The backbone of my analysis,allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL :** The chosen database management system,ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code :** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub :** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL script and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking. 

# The analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market.

Here's how i approached each question:

### 1 . Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify teh highest-paying roles,I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs.This query highlights the high paying opportunites in the field.
```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    company_dim.name AS company_name
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_location= 'India' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
